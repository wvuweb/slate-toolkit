Slate Toolkit
=============

A boilerplate for creating themes in [SlateCMS](http://slatecms.wvu.edu).

## What's included?
 * `.rhtml` files for native development within the CMS.
 * `.html` files for those who prefer to work in flat HTML and convert to `.rhtml` later. 
 * A Photoshop file with some basic typography, grid layout, WVU's global masthead and footer. 
 * A swatches file for Photoshop that contains the WVU brand colors.


## How do I use it?
1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/wvuweb/slate-toolkit/archive/master.zip).  
2. Choose the files/workflow approach you'd like (either starting in `.rhtml` or `.html`).
3. Develop your site, upload to Slate (or wherever) like you always have, and prosper.
