Sass Slate Toolkit (Beta)
=============

A **SCSS** boilerplate for creating themes in [SlateCMS](http://slatecms.wvu.edu).

## What's included?
 * `.rhtml` files for native development within the CMS.
 * `.html` files for those who prefer to work in flat HTML and convert to `.rhtml` later.
 * A `scss` folder for everything you need to hit the ground running with Sass.
 * A Photoshop file with some basic typography, grid layout, WVU's global masthead and footer. 
 * A swatches file for Photoshop that contains the WVU brand colors.


## How do I use it?
1. [Download the zip](https://github.com/wvuweb/slate-toolkit/archive/scss.zip).  
2. Use the `.rhtml` files (or convert those to normal HTML).
3. Drag your project's folder onto [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/index.php) ([Mixture](http://mixture.io), [Scout](http://mhs.github.io/scout-app/), or any other compiler will also work).
3. Develop your site, upload to Slate (or wherever) like you always have, and prosper.
